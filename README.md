# Spring_boot-API
created a restfull web service
tested for a mock get,put,post,delete methods and its working fine
added createUser method where user can sighn in by entering user's first_namelast_name email  and password and when the record gets stored in mysql DB the user is prompted with the userId ,first_name , last_name,email.[not gonna return password as JSON response] passwords are usually encrypted for security reasons!
